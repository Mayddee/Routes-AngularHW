  <h1>About This Project</h1>

  <p class="intro">
    This small web application was created as a learning project to practice 
    Angular routing, API integration, reusable components, and UI design.
  </p>

  <p>
    The project uses the public Harry Potter API to fetch detailed information 
    about characters from the Wizarding World. You can browse the list, search 
    for specific characters, and view complete details for each one.
  </p>

  <p>
    The goal of this project is simple:  
    <strong>improve frontend skills through a clean, structured, and real API-based application.</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    It also serves as a practical example of how to build modern Angular pages,
    manage navigation, handle loading/error states, and work with external data.
  </p>

    This project is not affiliated with J.K. Rowling or Warner Bros — it is 
    purely educational.
